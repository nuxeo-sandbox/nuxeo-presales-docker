You have now configured your Nuxeo Docker Compose setup. Please check the
above output to make sure build processes have completed and images have been
pulled.

The stack includes Nuxeo, MongoDB, OpenSearch, and OpenSearch Dashboards. Each
product runs under its own respective license agreement. Please check
docker-compose.yml for more details.

To start your stack, navigate to your Project directory and bring up the
applications:

 docker compose up -d

(but it is HIGHLY recommended to install the aliases! aliases.sh provides
shortcuts to common functions to build, start, and stop the stack configuration)

Nuxeo will launch on port 8080.
