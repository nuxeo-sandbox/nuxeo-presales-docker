You have now configured your Nuxeo Docker Compose setup.

The stack includes Nuxeo, MongoDB, Kibana, and ElasticSearch.  Each product runs under it's own respective license agreement.  Please check docker-compose.yml for more details.

To start your stack, navigate to your Project directory and bring up the applications:
  docker-compose up -d

Nuxeo will launch on port 8080.  If you wish to change ports, check the Docker environment (.env) file in your Project directory.
