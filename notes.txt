You have now configured your Nuxeo Docker Compose setup.  Please check the
above output to make sure build processes have completed and images have been
pulled.

The stack includes Nuxeo, MongoDB, Kibana, and ElasticSearch.  Each product
runs under its own respective license agreement.  Please check
docker-compose.yml for more details.

To start your stack, navigate to your Project directory and bring up the
applications:
  docker-compose up -d

(but it is HIGHLY recommended to install the aliases! See below...)

aliases.sh provides shortcuts to common functions to build, start, and stop
the stack configuration.

Nuxeo will launch on port 8080.  If you wish to change ports, check the Docker
environment (.env) file in your Project directory.  Check the logs for any
anomalous behavior.
